## Project Overview

LEMUR is an MSCA Doctoral Network focused on developing the theoretical foundations, algorithms, and applications of **Learning with Multiple Representations** (LMR). The core goal is to train 10 PhD researchers in novel approaches to machine learning that emphasize explainability, fairness, weak supervision, and environmental and social impact considerations. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
