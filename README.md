# LMR Toolbox

This repository serves as the central documentation and tooling hub for the **LEMUR** Doctoral Network on *Learning with Multiple Representations*. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

It contains:
- Instructions and links to the individual projects' repositories 
- Scripts to clone and run experiments locally
- Documentation about the project goals and methodology

---

## Project Overview

LEMUR is an MSCA Doctoral Network focused on developing the theoretical foundations, algorithms, and applications of **Learning with Multiple Representations** (LMR). The core goal is to train 10 PhD researchers in novel approaches to machine learning that emphasize explainability, fairness, weak supervision, and environmental and social impact considerations. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## Project Objectives

LEMUR’s goals are divided into three major facets:

1. **Foundations (F1)** — Develop formal guarantees and performance predictions for LMR. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
2. **Methods (F2)** — Create novel LMR algorithms, metrics, and ethical impact evaluations. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
3. **Applications (F3)** — Apply LMR techniques to real-world domains via collaborations with industry partners. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Structure

- `participants/` — Per-project summary with links to the respective repositories  
- `scripts/` — Helper scripts to clone and run project repos locally 
- `config/` — Config files consumed by scripts

---

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lemur-dn/lmr-toolbox
   cd lmr-toolbox

2. Review participants/ to see links to individual project repositories.

3. Run:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/clone_all.sh

## Contributing to the LMR Toolbox Repo

This repository accepts contributions in:
- Improving documentation in `docs/`
- Adding new helper scripts in `scripts/`
- Updating participant links in `participants/`

Please follow the general GitHub workflow:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Submit a pull request
